import cv2
import numpy as np

# Function to preprocess the image
def preprocess_image(image):
    # Convert image to grayscale
    gray = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
    # Apply Gaussian blur for noise reduction
    blurred = cv2.GaussianBlur(gray, (5, 5), 0)
    return blurred

# Function to detect fractures using grayscale morphology
def detect_fractures(image):
    # Apply morphological operations for edge detection
    kernel = np.ones((5, 5), np.uint8)
    erosion = cv2.erode(image, kernel, iterations=1)
    dilation = cv2.dilate(erosion, kernel, iterations=1)
    # Perform edge detection using Canny edge detector
    edges = cv2.Canny(dilation, 50, 150)
    # Find contours of potential fractures
    contours, _ = cv2.findContours(edges.copy(), cv2.RETR_EXTERNAL, cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE)
    # Draw contours on original image
    cv2.drawContours(image, contours, -1, (0, 255, 0), 2)
    return image

# Function to present results
def present_results(original_image, processed_image):
    # Display original and processed images
    cv2.imshow('Original Image', original_image)
    cv2.imshow('Fracture Detected Image', processed_image)
    cv2.waitKey(0)
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()

# Accessing X-ray image dataset (dummy data)
# Replace this with actual dataset loading code
image_path = 'bone.jpeg'
image = cv2.imread(image_path)

# Real-time fracture detection
processed_image = preprocess_image(image)
fracture_detected_image = detect_fractures(processed_image)

# Presenting results

## Result
There fore we can detect the fractured part image.

## i)Learners  can use X-ray image datasets from Kaggle.
 Yes, learners can indeed utilize X-ray image datasets from Kaggle for various purposes, including fracture detection. Kaggle hosts a variety of medical image datasets, some of which include X-ray images of fractures, which can be used for training machine learning models
 ## Discuss the advantages and challenges of using morphological operations for this specific medical application.
 Advantages:

Morphological operations are computationally efficient and can be implemented in real-time, making them suitable for processing large volumes of medical images.
They can effectively enhance and extract features of interest (such as fractures) from the images, aiding in accurate detection.
Morphological operations are versatile and can be adjusted to handle variations in image quality and noise levels.
They are relatively easy to understand and implement, making them accessible to both beginners and experts in medical image analysis.
Challenges:

Morphological operations are sensitive to parameter selection, and choosing appropriate parameters can be challenging.
Overprocessing or underprocessing the images can lead to inaccurate results, requiring careful tuning of the operations.
Morphological operations may not always be effective in handling complex fractures or fractures with low contrast, which may require more advanced techniques.
Real-time implementation may be challenging for large datasets or high-resolution images, requiring optimization techniques.
Interpretability of the results can be a challenge, especially when dealing with complex fractures or subtle abnormalities.
